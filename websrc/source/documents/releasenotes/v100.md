- Docker UCP 2.1.x support using v2 plugin is in experimental stage
- OpenShift support is in experimental stage

### Infrastructure Support
Bare Metal, vCenter VMs, AWS VMs

- vCenter VMs require VM port group to be configured (see [the VMWare documentation](https://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-65/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.vmware.vsphere.networking.doc%2FGUID-D5960C77-0D19-4669-A00C-B05D58A422F8.html) for more details). For L2 or ACI mode, port group needs to be configured using VLAN trunking to allow Virtual Guest Tagging. For L3 mode, port group can be configured using no VLAN if using External VLAN Tagging or assign a VLAN in the Port Group for Virtual Switch Tagging.
- Supported networking configuration for AWS VMs is VXLAN mode only
