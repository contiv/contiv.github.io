# Administering Contiv

Before your users begin creating network policies for their tenants, establish the appropriate role-based access for each user. Contiv provides the ability to authenticate your users
through your existing LDAP, or to create them locally if you are working on a proof of concept or other small project.

As a system administrator for Contiv, you can begin:

* [Managing tenants](/documents/admin/createTenant.html)
* [Managing users](/documents/admin/manageUsers.html)
* [Managing authorizations](/documents/admin/manageAuthorizations.html)
* [Managing nodes](/documents/admin/createNodes.html)
* [Managing LDAP](/documents/admin/manageLDAP.html)
* [Managing networks](/documents/admin/manageNetworks.html)

These tasks are all available to you in the [Contiv UI](https://github.com/contiv/contiv-ui) but you can also work with the [REST API]s(documents/api/contiv.html).
