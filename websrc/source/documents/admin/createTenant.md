# Managing Tenants
Tenants are the highest level of organization in Contiv. 

Create tenants and then you can assign the appropriate users and create networks. Users are authorized can view and use only the resources within their tenant, but can be assigned to multiple tenants.

## Create Tenants

Contiv ships with a single default tenant that you can use, or you can create new tenants.

To create tenants:

1. Select **Settings > Tenants**.
2. Click on **Create Tenants**.
3. Enter a tenant name and click **Create**.
   Note: Use numbers and letters. Capitals are okay. Do NOT use special characters or white spaces.

## Delete Tenants

If you are finished with a particular tenant, you can delete it.

To delete tenants:

1. Select **Settings > Tenants**.
2. Click on the name of the tenant you want to delete.
3. Click **Remove**.
4. Confirm that you want to remove the tenant.
