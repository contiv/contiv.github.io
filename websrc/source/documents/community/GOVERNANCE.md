  Governance Structure
---

Contiv is divided into a set of projects, each project consisting of multiple repos and associated set of maintainers. Click on specific links below to see project specific information:

* [Core Networking](GOVERNANCE-corenetworking.html)
* [Deployment](GOVERNANCE-deployment.html)
* [Docs](GOVERNANCE-docs.html)
* [Tools](GOVERNANCE-tools.html)
* [UI/AuthProxy](GOVERNANCE-ui-authproxy.html)

Committers for a project may merge pull request for all repos in the project, and in the event of dispute not resolvable via consensus, decisions are made via a vote of the committers.
 
New committers may be proposed by existing committers.  The decision to add a new committer is made by majority vote of existing committers.

Committers may request reviews from non-committers at their discretion in order to aid discussion on a pull requeust/issue.
 
An existing committer may be removed by:
 
1.  Request of that committer
1.  Majority vote of existing committers iff:
  * The committer to be removed has been disruptive
  * The committer to be removed has been idle in the project for more than 6 months
 
New projects may be added to Contiv by proposal of a committer to a Contiv project, upon majority vote of all committers across all Contiv projects (one vote per person).
 
A repo may only be moved from its current Contiv project to another Contiv project iff:

1.  The 'donor' project committers agree by majority vote
1.  The 'recipient' project committers agree by majority vote
